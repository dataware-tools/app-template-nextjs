## First thing to do

The things you have to do after creating a repository based on this template are as follows:

- Change `name` in `package.json` to the name of your application
- Change `repository` in `package.json` to the newly created repository
- Change `homepage` in `package.json` to your application name
  - This should be the same as `urlPrefix` in
    [App Catalog](https://github.com/dataware-tools/protocols/blob/master/catalogs/app.json)
    if you want to register your application to dataware-tools

## Getting started

First, install all dependencies.
